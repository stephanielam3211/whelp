                <p>In this project, I developed a website for enhancing my public image using
                HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also showcased my ability to toggle between different
                styles applying CSS and Javascript. This project allowed me to get creative with both
                HTML and CSS and also get accustomed to the coding style and how to format the layout

            <div class="project2">
                <p>In this project, I used OpenGL and C++ to create a basic paint program that could
                change the paintbrush from a square paintbrush into a circular paintbrush. I also
                included the ability to change the color of the paintbrush by using keys 0-7 and also
                the ability to change the color of the background without affecting the drawing itself.
                Additionally, I had implemented a spray-paint brush which allows the user to paint as
                if they are using spray paint.</p>

            <div class="project3">
                <p>In this project, I worked with OpenGL and C++ to rasterize both triangles and lines
                rendering image spaces. I had explored the usage of rasterization algorithms to
                construct various rendered environments. This project taught me how to render images
                and understand the process of rasterization as well as the math behind it.
