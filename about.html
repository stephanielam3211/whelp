        <div class="p1"><p>I am currently a student at Texas A&M University majoring in 
            computer science <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html">A&M</a> 
            and a mathematics minor who has a passion in 
            artificial intelligence and graphic design. I have a coding background 
            in Java, Javascript, Python, C++, OpenGL, HTML, and CSS. In my free time, I enjoy 
            baking, playing the piano, and going ice skating. Having done both 
            piano and figure skating since I was young, these two activities have 
            always been of great enjoyment to me. I am passionate about graphics design 
            since I like drawing and into the creative arts. Being able to create animations 
            for a movie would be something I would enjoy doing as a career.</p>
            <p>Having recently finished a small coding project making a basic paint 
            program, I realized that graphic design is something I enjoy doing. I have also 
            participated in coding competitions, and I hope to do a HACKathon this year. I 
            have also participated undergraduate research where I got the opportunity to learn 
            about smart contract verification and the Ethereum. Although I have not yet gotten 
            an internship, I hope I can get one this upcoming summer and I hope that it will 
            either be related to artificial intelligence or graphic design.</p>
            <p>My goal is to hopefully one day create an AI robot that can help medical 
            professionals with their job in the diagnosis of patients. The job of this AI 
            robot is to do in-person diagnosis for patients who are contagious and have a 
            possible lethal sickness in place of a doctor or nurse. The AI robot would also 
            do a preliminary screening of the patient to help ease the workload of nurses. 
            Having seen the risk medical professionals have to take every day to care for 
            the sick and most recently with the ongoing pandemic has inspired me to want 
            to create this robot that can help them. With this technology, I hope it will 
            decrease the risk of health-care workers when they need to diagnose a potentially 
            contagious and lethal virus in a patient.</p>

                <p>I am currently a teaching assistant for Texas A&M University

                their introductory programming coursework, tutoring and assisting students regarding
                the Python programming language, and assisting the professor with grading class materials.

                <p>I also used to work part time at Code Ninjas as a programming instructor to kids. I
                taught students software development fundamentals including Javascript on the frontend of
                programming and also robotics.

                <p>I had done considerable volunteering work in the past as part of the Congressional Award
                program. I volunteered at SEVA clinic which is a non-profit organization whose goal is to
                help those who do not have an insurance or money to see them at a regular hospital. There,
                I was in charge of inputting patient information into the database for medical professionals 
                to see when the patient saw them. <a href="http://www.sevaclinic-texas.org/">SEVA</a> I had also volunteered for the production of Nutcracker on ice
                at Memorial City in Houston. I was in charge of mainly assisting my coaches with the preparation
                of props as well the performer's time to get on stage.
